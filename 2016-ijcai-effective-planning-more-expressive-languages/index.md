This paper is an invited submission to the IJCAI 2016 Sister Conferences Track of the awarded
["Modeling and Computation in Planning: Better Heuristics from More
Expressive Languages"]({{ '/' | prepend: site.baseurl }}{{ site.pubs.icaps2015.slug }}), ICAPS 2015.

The text has been updated to reflect some of the research progress since the original publication,
but the experimental section figures, and thus the exact planner version and benchmarks,
are the same than in the original paper.
